The message chain smell arises when a particular class is highly coupled to other classes in chain-like delegations. To illustrate this smell, suppose we have Class A who needs data from Class E. To retrieve this data, object A firstly needs to retrieve object E from object D from object C from object B.
The problem which lies here is that as A tried to access the data at Class E, A becomes unnecessarily coupled to class B, C, D along the way; when it needs only to get the data from E.
However, sometimes delegations are needed, and thus delegation chains with a couple of links are often considered to be harmless. The argument as to how many links a chain can reasonably have is often related to other factors. Consider the other design maxims mentioned below for more guidance related to designs with highly coupled chained delegations.
