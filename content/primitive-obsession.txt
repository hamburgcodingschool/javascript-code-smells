This smell occurs when a programmer uses primitives to represent a concept in the program rather than creating a small class for it instead. Creating a class to represent a concept means that you can add behavior to it and group several data items together that belong together.
If this occurs, you should Replace Data Value with Object or if there are several fields that should go together you should use the refactoring Extract Class.
